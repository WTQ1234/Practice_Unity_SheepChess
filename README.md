# Practice_Unity_SheepChess
A programming exercises as Sheep Chess in Unity, and I used dotween and odin.

Not for commercial use, the picture is from internet.

Because of the copyright, I remove the odin inspector plugin, you can get it from https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041

I made it about 1 years ago.

View it in the video: https://youtu.be/z5AX1iuLOAg

Hope you like it.
